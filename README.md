## **The Old Sea Turtle**
This project contains the collective work of four (not a typo) determined students, who cobbled together this web application under immense pressure from scheduling conflicts, language barriers, JavaScript scoping, and a lack of caffeine.
The code has been documented where it's been deemed necessary, and we hope that the purpose of each block of code has been made apparent.

The (approximate) distribution of the work load is as follows:
* **Yixin Huang**: Took care of inventory management, with editing stock and adding/removing items. Performed remarkably despite some minor struggles with English.

* **Joel Alarcón**: Handled the presentation of all items in stock, with relevant descriptors. Unfortunately, his work could not be implemented in time, and we deemed that Yixin's work would suffice to fill the same role. His work has been included in 'AvailableItems.js' for posterity. Joel also handled Spanish translations.

* **Ayo Eyesan**: Managed authentication functionality, as well as French translations. Designed a hook for Google Translate API, which we unfortunately did not utilize for this project (but has been yoinked by every single member of the team for use in their own projects).

* **Daniel Berggren**: Unfortunately, had to leave the team (with a notice sent on the last day before deadline). 
**No work has been produced by Daniel, and therefore nothing has been included in this project.**

* **Samuel Möller**: In charge of framework, ordering, UNDO-REDO, drag-and-drop, graphical design, styling, utility functions, integration of everyone's solutions, team management, and fiddling with details and doodads. Made an especially great effort in the project due to previous experience with programming and web development.

The work done on this project has been sporadic and in bursts, but ultimately, this team pulled together to deliver a worthy final product. Development was not as smooth as one could hope, but this is mainly due to lacking experience with JavaScript/jQuery and heavy scheduling conflicts with other university courses.

In conclusion, we're all proud of what has been produced, and hope the results are satisfactory.
